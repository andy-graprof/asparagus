asparagus THANKS file

asparagus has originally been written by Andreas Grapentin. This file aims at
listing all people who positively supported the development of asparagus, for
example by suggesting features, pointing out problems, or contributing in any
other way, ordered by the time they first added to the project. If you feel
that your name is missed here, contact <asparagus@grapentin.org>.
